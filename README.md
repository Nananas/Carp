<i>WARNING! This is a research project and a lot of information here might become outdated and misleading without any explanation. Don't use it for anything important!</i>

<i>Update (June 26, 2017): The total rewrite is now live; if you want to look at the old version, it's under the branch named "c" in this repository.</i>

## About

Carp is a small programming language designed to work well for interactive and performance sensitive use cases like games, sound synthesis and visualizations.

The key features of Carp are the following:
* Automatic and deterministic memory management (no garbage collector or VM)
* Inferred static types for great speed and reliability
* Ownership tracking enables a functional programming style while still using mutation of cache-friendly data structures under the hood
* No hidden performance penalties – allocation and copying are explicit
* Straightforward integration with existing C code

The Carp REPL has built-in documentation, run ```(help)``` to access it!

## A Small Example

```clojure
(use IO)
(use Int)
(use String)

(defn main []
  (do (println "~ The number guessing game ~")
      (print "Please enter a number between 1 - 99: ")
      (let [play true
            answer (random-between 1 100)]
        (while play
          (let [guess (get-line)
                num (from-string &guess)]
            (if (= &guess "q\n")
              (do
                (println "Good bye...")
                (set! play false))
              (do
                (cond (< num answer) (println "Too low.")
                      (> num answer) (println "Too high.")
                      (println "Correct!"))
                (print "Please guess again: "))))))))
```

To build this example, save it to a file called 'example.carp' and load it with ```(load "example.carp")```, then execute ```(build)``` to build an executable, and ```(run)``` to start.
